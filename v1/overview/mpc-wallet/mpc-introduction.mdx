Cobo MPC Wallet leverages advanced Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology to implement a Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).

With MPC-TSS technology, private key-shares are individually generated within
separate secure environments, encrypted, and divided amongst multiple parties.
These parties will jointly sign transactions without ever exposing their
individual key-share to one another, or materializing the full private key at
any point. This ensures that the private key never exists or resides in any one
device, effectively removing the single point of failure and insulating user
assets from security attacks and human errors.

In Cobo's MPC Wallet, a typical set up is 2-out-of-3 TSS, where
Cobo stores and manages one of the three key shares. The client holds one of
the three key shares. The last key share is either stored by the client in an
offline environment or entrusted to a dedicated third party key backup/recovery
service provide, i.e. insurance or security companies. Only Cobo and the client
are required to cooperate to sign transactions, the backup key share are only
needed in extreme conditions, e.g. one of Cobo or client's key share is
damaged or lost.

# Benefits

- No Single Point of Failure

  - Key sharding achieves decentralization and ensures that no unauthorized party can unilaterally move your funds, preventing asset loss from external hacks or internal fraud and collusion.

- Lower Transaction Fees

  - MPC-TSS runs entirely off-chain, minimizing gas fees while maximizing security.

- Asset Recovery Assurance

  - If your key-share is lost or compromised, or in the event of any catastrophic event or system failure, remaining key-shares can collaborate to ensure that you can access and recover your assets.

- Comprehensive Token Support

  - MPC technology is chain- and asset-agnostic by design, enabling easy onboarding of new tokens.
  - 1,200+ tokens across 27+ chains supported currently, encompassing the majority of active public blockchains, and we are constantly expanding this list.

- Easy and Safe Access to Web3

  - Securely connect to a multitude of DApps including DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, etc, and interact directly with Web3 using Cobo Connect browser extension.

- Enhanced Operational Flexibility

  - MPC technology allows for easy ongoing modifications to access controls and approval thresholds, enabling seamless operational adjustments as your organization scales.

# Key Features

## MPC-TSS Configuration

With MPC-TSS, a flexible quorum approval scheme (“m out of n” key-shares) can be implemented. Cobo recommends a “2 out of 3” configuration, where three MPC key-shares will be generated independently by you, Cobo, and an entrusted third party disaster recovery service provider. To sign transactions, at least two key-shares (you and Cobo) are required to participate. The key-share held by the entrusted third party disaster recovery service provider is securely stored offline at all times and is solely intended for backup and recovery purposes, such as if your key-share is lost or compromised, or in the rare event that Cobo services were disrupted.

## Disaster Recovery

Cobo MPC Wallet provides comprehensive key recovery capabilities to ensure that you have control and access to your assets under all circumstances. If your key-share is lost or compromised, you can initiate ‘soft’ key recovery to generate a new set of three MPC key-shares. In the unlikely event that Cobo MPC Wallet is no longer in service, you can initiate ‘hard’ key recovery with the entrusted third party to reconstruct the MPC root extended private key and take over full control of your assets. These key recovery mechanisms are designed to ensure that you have the peace of mind that your assets are safe and protected at all times.

## Transaction Co-Management

With Cobo MPC Wallet, you can co-manage funds with your clients and/or business partners. Using Cobo's mobile SDK and Cobo’s authenticator app (external parties can seamlessly participate in transaction approval and signing. This extends the reach of custody technology beyond your organization to your entire business ecosystem.
