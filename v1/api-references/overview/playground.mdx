## Introduction

The interactive API Playground is a feature designed specifically for developers who require quick understanding of API responses,
enabling them to browse and interact with the endpoints.
**To use this feature, you must first create a Cobo Custody account in the development environment and use the corresponding API Key.**
Kindly note that accounts and API Keys* from the production environment are not compatible with the API Playground.

Once your account is set up in the development environment, you'll need to configure the corresponding API-KEY and API-SECRET.
This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to complete these setup processes.
Before you proceed, kindly make sure that you have already completed the following prerequisites:

1. Created a Cobo Custody account in the development environment
2. Successfully generated an API-KEY and an API-SECRET
3. Successfully added your API-KEY on the Cobo Custody Web platform


<Warning>For security reasons, please NEVER input your API Secret from the production environment while using the API Playground.</Warning>
