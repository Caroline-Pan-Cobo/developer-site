      The status of key share holder's TSS Node. Possible values include:
      - `Valid`: The TSS Node is configured and activated.
      
      - `NotConfigured`: The TSS Node has not been configured. This status is only applicable to [mobile co-signer](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/back-up-key-share-groups#mobile-co-signer) using the [Cobo Guard](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/guard/introduction).
      
      - `NotActivated`: The TSS Node has not been activated. This status is only applicable to [mobile co-signer](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/back-up-key-share-groups#mobile-co-signer) using the [Cobo Guard](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/guard/introduction).
      
      - `Changed`: The TSS Node has been changed. This happens when the key share holder sets up their [Cobo Guard](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/guard/introduction) on a new phone. This `Changed` status serves as a reminder for you to call [Create TSS request](/api-references/v2/wallets--mpc-wallet/create-a-tss-request-to-generate-key-secrets-for-a-tss-group) with the `KeyGenFromKeyGroup` and `Recovery` action `type` to finalize the setup of the key share holder's new phone. Once all set, the old TSS Node with the `Changed` status will be deleted.
