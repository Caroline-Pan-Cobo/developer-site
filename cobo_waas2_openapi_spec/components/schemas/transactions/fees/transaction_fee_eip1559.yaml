  The transaction fee that you are willing to pay based on the EIP-1559 fee model for some Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. You need to specify the fee type (transaction fee model), maximum priority fee, and fee price for the chain or token. You can get the fee model and fee price for the chain or token by calling [Get transaction fee price](./fee_price). 
  
  The transaction fee is calculated by multiplying the sum of the base fee price and the maximum priority fee by the gas units used by the transaction. This can be expressed as: Transaction fee = (base fee price + maximum priority fee) * gas units used.

  You can set a gas limit to control the used gas units.
