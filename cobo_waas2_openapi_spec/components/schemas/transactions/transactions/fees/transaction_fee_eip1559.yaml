  The transaction fee based on the EIP-1559 fee model for some Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. 
  The estimated transaction fee is calculated by multiplying the sum of the base fee and the maximum priority fee by the gas limit. This can be expressed as: Transaction fee = (base fee + maximum priority fee) * gas limit.
