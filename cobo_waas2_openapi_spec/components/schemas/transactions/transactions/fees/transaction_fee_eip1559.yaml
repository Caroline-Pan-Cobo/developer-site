  The transaction fee actually charged by the chain that uses the EIP-1559 fee model. 
  The transaction fee is calculated by multiplying the sum of the base fee price and the priority fee by the used gas. This can be expressed as: Transaction fee = (base fee price + maximum priority fee) * used gas.
