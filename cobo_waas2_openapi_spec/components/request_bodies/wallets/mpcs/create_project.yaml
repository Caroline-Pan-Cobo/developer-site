            The number of key share holders in the Project.
            
            **Notes:**
            1. Currently, the available [Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS)](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction#threshold-signature-scheme-tss) are 2-2, 2-3, and 3-3 schemes (`threshold`-`node_count`), so you can only set `node_count` to 2 or 3. 
            
            2. `threshold` must be less than or equal to `node_count`.
          example: 3
        threshold:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The number of key share holders required to sign an operation in the Project.
