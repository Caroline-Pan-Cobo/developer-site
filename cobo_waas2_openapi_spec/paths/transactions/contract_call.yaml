  summary: Create transaction to call smart contract
  description: |
    This endpoint generates a transaction to invoke a function within a smart contract on the blockchain.
    The request body should include details such as the contract address, function to call, and any required parameters encoded as the calldata.
    Upon successful creation, a transaction request is returned, which can then be submitted to the blockchain for execution.
    This endpoint only applies to ethereum-like blockchains for now.
