  summary: Speed up transaction by ID
  description: |
    This operation speeds up a specified transaction. 

    Speeding up a transaction will trigger a Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transaction, which allows the you to replace your unconfirmed transaction with a new one with a higher transaction fee. A transaction can be sped up if it is unconfirmed and has not yet been added to a block on the blockchain. 
    
    A transaction request for tracking is returned upon successful operation.
