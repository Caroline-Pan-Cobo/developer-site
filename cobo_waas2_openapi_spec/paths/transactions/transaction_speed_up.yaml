  summary: Speed up transaction by ID
  description: |
    This operation accelerates a specified transaction. 

    Speeding up a transaction will trigger a Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transaction, which allows the you to replace your unconfirmed transaction with a new one with a higher transaction fee. A transaction can be accelerated if its status is either of the following:
    - `Submitted`
    - `PendingScreening`
    - `PendingAuthorization`
    - `PendingSignature`
    - `Broadcasting`
    - `Confirming`
    
    A transaction request for tracking is returned upon successful operation.
