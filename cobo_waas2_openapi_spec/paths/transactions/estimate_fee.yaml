  summary: Estimate transaction fee
  description: |
    This operation estimates the transaction fee of a token transfer or a contract call, based on factors such as network congestion and transaction complexity.
    
    You need to specify the transaction information, including the source, destination, fee type (transaction fee model), and transaction fee price. You can get the fee model and fee price for the chain or token by calling [Get transaction fee price](./fee_price).
