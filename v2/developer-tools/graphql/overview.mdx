This guide provides an overview of the Cobo GraphQL API.

## About GraphQL

GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need in a single request, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. For more details, refer to the official website [GraphQL](https://graphql.org).

## About Cobo GraphQL API
Cobo's GraphQL API provides real-time access to blockchain, wallet, and transaction data from WaaS 2.0. Compared with REST APIs, GraphQL enables clients to define responses dynamically, optimizing performance and reducing API calls for faster and more efficient data retrieval.

## Key features

The Cobo GraphQL API supports the following features:

### Pagination  
The API supports cursor-based pagination and page-based pagination (connection queries) for efficient data retrieval.

- Uses `first`, `last`, `before`, and `after` for navigation.  
- `first` and `last` values must be in the range [1, 100].  
- Some schemas may apply to stricter limits.

**Example: Fetching the next 10 wallets after a given cursor**
```graphql
query {
  wallets(first: 10, after: "cursor_value") {
    edges {
      node {
        walletId
        name
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
  }
}
```

### Sorting  
Clients can sort query results by specifying sorting parameters. Available sorting fields include `createdTimestamp`, `TotalValue`, `Name`, `TradingTime`.

**Example: Sorting transactions by `createdTimestamp`**
```graphql
query {
  transactions(walletId: "123", sort: { field: CREATED_TIMESTAMP, order: DESC }) {
    edges {
      node {
        transactionId
        createdTimestamp
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Field selection  
GraphQL allows users to retrieve only the necessary fields, reducing unnecessary data transfer and improving efficiency.

**Example: Requesting only `walletId` and `name` for a wallet**
```graphql
query {
  walletById(id: "wallet_123") {
    walletId
    name
  }
}
```

### Nested queries  
Clients can fetch related objects in a single request, reducing multiple API calls and improving efficiency.

**Example: Retrieving a walletâ€™s transactions and token balances**
```graphql
query {
  walletById(id: "wallet_123") {
    walletId
    transactions(first: 5) {
      edges {
        node {
          transactionId
          status
        }
      }
    }
    tokenBalances {
      edges {
        node {
          balance
          token {
            symbol
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

## Accessing the API with Cobo CLI

In addition to sending GraphQL requests manually, you can also use [Cobo CLI](/v2/developer-tools/cobo-cli/graphql-queries) to send queries directly from your terminal. This is especially useful for testing, scripting, or automation scenarios.
