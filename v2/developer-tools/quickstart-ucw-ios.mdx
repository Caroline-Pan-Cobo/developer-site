## Overview

This guide introduces how to get started with using the [UCW SDK (iOS)](/v2/developer-tools/ucw-sdk/initialize-secrets/initialize-secrets), which is required to [implement your own MPC Wallets (User-Controlled Wallets)](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/get-started-ucw), and allows you to integrate the UCW SDK into your [Client App](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/get-started-ucw#technical-architecture) to interact with the [Cobo TSS Relay](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/get-started-ucw#technical-architecture).

You can go to [GitHub](https://github.com/CoboGlobal/cobo-ucw-sdk-ios) to access the source code of the [UCW SDK](/v2/developer-tools/ucw-sdk/initialize-secrets/initialize-secrets).


## Install the UCW SDK

You can install the UCW SDK as a dependency in a [Swift package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/swift-packages) or an Xcode project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Swift package">
      To install UCW SDK as a dependency in a Swift package, follow these instructions:
      1. Create a Swift package with Xcode, see [Creating a standalone Swift package with Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-a-standalone-swift-package-with-xcode).
      2. Add UCW SDK to the `dependencies` in your `Package.swift` file:

            ```swift
            dependencies: [
                .package(url: "https://github.com/CoboGlobal/cobo-ucw-sdk-ios")
            ]

            ```

3. Add the following to the `target`:
    ```swift
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "<project_name>",
            dependencies: ["UCWSDK"]
        )
    ]

    ```

4. In the source file where you want to use UCW SDK, add the following:

    ```swift
    import UCWSDK
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Xcode project">
    To install UCW SDK as a dependency in an Xcode project, follow these instructions:
    1. Set up your [Client App](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/get-started-ucw#technical-architecture)'s application development environment with Xcode, see [Creating an Xcode project for an app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-an-xcode-project-for-an-app).
    2. Once your Xcode project is set up, click **File** > **Add Package Dependency** in Xcode and enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/CoboGlobal/cobo-ucw-sdk-ios`. For more details, see [Adding package dependencies to your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app).
    3. In the source file where you want to use UCW SDK, add the following:

        ```swift
        import UCWSDK
        ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Code samples

This section demonstrates the implementation of steps directly involving the UCW SDK when creating a Main Group. For a complete guide on creating a Main Group or implementing your own MPC Wallets (User-Controlled Wallets), see [Get started with MPC Wallets (User-Controlled Wallets)](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/get-started-ucw).

For operation-specific documentation and sample code, see [UCW SDK operations on Developer Hub](/v2/developer-tools/ucw-sdk/initialize-secrets/initialize-secrets).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Initialize Secrets">
        This step corresponds to Step 1 under **Complete the initial setup** > **Initialize UCW SDK** in [Get started with MPC Wallets (User-Controlled Wallets)](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/get-started-ucw). See [Initialize Secrets](/v2/developer-tools/ucw-sdk/initialize-secrets/initialize-secrets) for the documentation of this operation.

        ```swift
        let secrets = "secrets.db"
        let passphrase = "d3hxNyoiAP@Lm!D7Qpo_hghdpgyc_r39"

        Task {
           do {
               let nodeID = try await initializeSecrets(secretsFile: secrets, passphrase: passphrase)
               print(" TSS Node ID: \(nodeID)")
           } catch {
               print("Error: \(error)")
           }
        }

        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create UCW SDK">
        This step corresponds to Step 1 under **Complete the initial setup** > **Create a Main Group** in [Get started with MPC Wallets (User-Controlled Wallets)](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/get-started-ucw). See [Create UCW](/v2/developer-tools/ucw-sdk/ucw-class/create-ucw) for the documentation of this operation.

        let sdkConfig = SDKConfig(env: Env.development, timeout: 30, debug: true)
        var sdkInstance: UCW?
        var connCode: ConnCode = .CodeUnknown
        var connMessage: String? = ""
