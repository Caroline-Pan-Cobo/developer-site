## Prerequisites

- Follow the instructions in Cobo Portal's [Quick start guide](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/quick-start-guide) to set up your Cobo Portal account and create your organization. If an organization has already been set up, ask your organization admin to invite you to join the organization.
- Basic knowledge of the command line interface


## Install Cobo CLI

### System requirements

Cobo CLI is supported on most operating systems. Ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- macOS (10.14 Mojave or later)
- Windows 10 or later
- Linux (most distributions supported)

### Install Cobo CLI
Choose the installation method that best suits your operating system:


#### Use pip
You can install Cobo CLI using pip, which works on all supported operating systems:


```shell
pip install cobo-cli
```
Ensure that you have Python 3.9 or newer installed.

#### Use Homebrew

You can install Cobo CLI on macOS using Homebrew:

```shell
brew install cobo-cli
```


### Verify the installation

To verify that Cobo CLI has been installed correctly, open a new terminal and run the following command:

```shell
cobo version
```

## Log in and authenticate

After installing Cobo CLI, you need to authenticate your Cobo CLI to Cobo WaaS 2.0. You can choose one of the [three authentication methods](/v2/developer-tools/cobo-cli/login-and-authentication) to authenticate. As an example, this guide will show you how to authenticate with your Cobo Portal account:

1. Switch to use your Cobo Portal account to authenticate:

    ```
    cobo auth user
    ```
2. Run the following command to initiate the user login process:

    ```
    cobo login --user
    ```
3. You'll be prompted to open a browser to continue the authorization process. Complete the authorization process in your browser, granting the necessary permissions for Cobo CLI to access your organization. 


## Configure your environment
Configure your environment for development or production use. We always recommend starting with the development environment:

```
cobo env dev
```


For more information about environments, see [Development and production environments](/v2/guides/overview/environments).

## Send your first request

Now you have successfully installed and configured Cobo CLI. It is time to explore what you can do with Cobo CLI.

### List all Custodial Wallets:

If you already have one or more Custodial Wallets, you can list all your Custodial Wallets by running the following command:

```shell
cobo get /wallets --wallet_type Custodial 
```

### Look up API documentation

If you have questions about a specific API operation, you can look up the API documentation by running the following command:

```shell
cobo doc /wallets
```
### Create a new application

Create a new application using a template, with the WaaS SDK integrated:

```shell
cobo app init
```
