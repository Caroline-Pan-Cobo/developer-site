Use the `app upload` command to publish your Cobo Portal Apps to Cobo Portal. For more details about publish Cobo Portal Apps, refer to [Publish the app](/v2/apps/build-app#publish-the-app).

Before uploading your Cobo Portal Apps, ensure the following:
- Verify the [app manifest file](/v2/apps/build-app#configure-the-manifest-file) is configured correctly.
- Log into Cobo CLI with your Cobo Portal account.
- Generate an app key if you haven't done so. For more details, refer to [Generate keys](/v2/developer-tools/cobo-cli/key-management#generate-keys).
- Run the command from the project directory where the manifest file is located.

Upon successful upload, an `app_id` value will be automatically added to the app manifest file. 

<Note>A Cobo Portal App can be uploaded only once. For any further updates, you will need to use the [update command](/v2/developer-tools/cobo-cli/app-update).</Note>
