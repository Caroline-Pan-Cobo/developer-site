Cobo CLI supports GraphQL query that allows you to execute complex queries and retrieve specific data from the WaaS 2.0 API.

For more details about GraphQL, please refer to [GraphQL's official website](https://graphql.org/).

<Note>To make API requests, you need to authenticate your requests by logging in and setting up your API keys.</Note>

## Usage

```shell
cobo graphql -q <query>
```

## Options

- `-q, --query`: The GraphQL query to execute, a JSON string containing a `query` key.
  <Info>If your query is a simple string rather than a JSON string, Cobo CLI will automatically wrap it in the required JSON structure.</Info>
- `-v, --variables`: Include variables in your GraphQL query using a JSON string.
- `--raw`: Output the raw JSON response without formatting.

## Example

### Retrieve transactions information about a specified wallet

```shell
cobo graphql -q '{
  "query": "
    {
      transactions(walletId: \"f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479\", limit: 5) {
        id
        type
        status
        amount {
          tokenId
          value
        }
      }
    }
  "
}'
```

This command retrieves the last 5 transactions for a specific wallet whose wallet ID is `f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479`.

### Get MPC vault information with variables

```shell
cobo graphql -q '{
  "query": "
    query($vaultId: ID!) {
      mpcVault(id: $vaultId) {
        id
        name
        type
        rootPubkeys {
          rootPubkey
          curve
        }
      }
    }
  "
}' -v '{
  "vaultId": "YPdbyVaVGqXXjkUsohHw"
}'
```

This command retrieves information about an MPC vault using vault ID as a variable.

### Get wallet information in the raw JSON format

```shell
cobo graphql -q "{ wallets { id name } }" --raw
```

This command retrieves information of specified wallets in the raw JSON format.

## Tips for Using GraphQL with Cobo CLI

- Always validate your queries before executing them in a production environment to avoid potential issues.
- For complex queries, consider writing your query in a separate file and using command substitution to pass it to Cobo CLI. You can refer to the following command for example: 

   ```shell
   cobo graphql -q "$(cat your_query.graphql)"
   ```

- Escape special characters in your query.
