Cobo CLI allows you to switch between the [development and production environments](/v2/guides/overview/environments). This guide explains how to switch between environments effectively. Always remember to switch to the correct environment before executing commands to avoid unintended actions in the wrong environment.


<Note>
Cobo CLI is designed for use in the development environment by default. Always exercise caution when using it in the production environment, and ensure you understand the implications of each command before execution.
</Note>

## View current environment

To check which environment is currently active, use:

```shell
cobo env
```

This command will display the name of the currently active environment.



## Set environment

To switch to a different environment, use the following command:

```shell
cobo env <environment>
```

Replace `<environment>` with your desired environment (`dev` or `prod`). This command will set the specified environment as the active one for subsequent CLI commands.
<Info>
If you don't specify an environment, Cobo CLI defaults to the "development" environment.
</Info>
## Override environment for a single command

You can override the current environment for a single command by using the
global `-e` or `--env` option:

```shell
cobo -e <environment> {command}
```

This allows you to execute a command in a specific environment without changing the overall active environment.
