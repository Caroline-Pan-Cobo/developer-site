title: 'Trigger webhook events'
---

Use this command to test the functionality of your webhook endpoint by triggering a test webhook event. The test event will be sent to all the webhook endpoints you have registered on Cobo Portal. You can optionally provide the `override_data` option to customize the payload.

## Usage

```shell
cobo webhook trigger <event_type> [options]
```

## Arguments
`<event_type>`: The webhook event type you want to trigger. Possible values include:
  - `wallets.transaction.created`
  - `wallets.transaction.updated`
  - `wallets.transaction.failed`
  - `wallets.transaction.succeeded`
  - `wallets.mpc.tss_request.created`
  - `wallets.mpc.tss_request.updated`
  - `wallets.mpc.tss_request.failed`
  - `wallets.mpc.tss_request.succeeded`

  <Info>You can also run the [cobo webhook events](/v2/developer-tools/cobo-cli/event-types) command to get the latest list of all available event types.</Info>

## Options
`--override <json_string>`: Override specific fields in the event payload with the provided JSON string.

## Example

This command triggers a `wallets.transaction.updated` event with the specified `chain_id` and `amount` values:

```shell
cobo webhook trigger wallets.transaction.updated --override '{"chain_id": "ETH", "amount": "1000000000000000000"}'
```

## Best Practices
- **Test all event types**: Trigger events for all the webhook types your application is subscribed to, ensuring your system can handle each type correctly.
- **Use realistic data**: When overriding event data, try to use realistic values that match your production scenarios.
- **Test error handling**: Trigger events with edge case data to ensure your webhook consumer can handle unexpected scenarios.
- **Verify webhook delivery**: After triggering an event, check your webhook endpoint logs to confirm that the event was received and processed correctly.
