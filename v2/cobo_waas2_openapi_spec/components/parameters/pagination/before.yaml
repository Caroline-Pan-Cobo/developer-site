name: before
in: query
description: |
  An object ID which serves as a cursor for pagination. For example, if you specify `before` as `RqeEoTkgKG5rpzqYzg2Hd3szmPoj2cE7w5jWwShz3C1vyGmk1`, the request will retrieve a list of data objects that end before the object with the specified ID `RqeEoTkgKG5rpzqYzg2Hd3szmPoj2cE7w5jWwShz3C1vyGmk1`. You can set this parameter to the value of `pagination.after` in the response of the previous request.
  
  If you set both `after` or `before`, only the setting of `before` will take effect.
  
  If the `before` and `after` are both set to empty, the first slice is returned.
  If the `before` is set to `infinity`, the last slice is returned.
