description: |
  An object ID that serves as a starting point for retrieving data in reverse chronological order. For example, if you specify `before` as `RqeEoTkgKG5rpzqYzg2Hd3szmPoj2cE7w5jWwShz3C1vyGmk1`, the request will retrieve a list of data objects that end before the object with the object ID `RqeEoTkgKG5rpzqYzg2Hd3szmPoj2cE7w5jWwShz3C1vyGmk1`. You can set this parameter to the value of `pagination.before` in the response of the previous request.
  
  - If you set both `after` and `before`, a exception will triggerd.

  - If you leave both `before` and `after` empty, the first page of data is returned.
  
  - If you set `before` to `infinity`, the last page of data is returned.
