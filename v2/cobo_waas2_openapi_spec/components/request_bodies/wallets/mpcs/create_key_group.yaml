          description: |
            The type of the key share group to create. Possible values include:
            
            - `MainKeyGroup`: The created key share group will be a [Main Group](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/create-key-share-groups).
            
            - `SigningKeyGroup`: The created key share group will be a [Signing Group](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/create-key-share-groups).
            
            - `RecoveryKeyGroup`: The created key share group will be a [Recovery Group](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/create-key-share-groups).
            
            **Note:** For `MainKeyGroup` and `SigningKeyGroup`, a Cobo key share holder will be added automatically.
        node_count:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The number of key share holders in this key share group.
            
            **Notes:**
            1. Currently, the available [Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS)](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction#threshold-signature-scheme-tss) are 2-2, 2-3, and 3-3 schemes (`threshold`-`node_count`), so you can only set `node_count` to 2 or 3. 

            2. `threshold` must be less than or equal to `node_count`.
          example: 3
        threshold:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The number of key share holders required to sign an operation.

                  - `MOBILE`: TSS Node was generated by a [mobile co-signer](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/back-up-key-share-groups#mobile-co-signer) using the [Cobo Guard](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/guard/introduction).
                  
                  - `API`: TSS Node was generated aby an [API co-signer](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/back-up-key-share-groups#api-co-signer) using the [TSS Node software package](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/tss-node-deployment).
