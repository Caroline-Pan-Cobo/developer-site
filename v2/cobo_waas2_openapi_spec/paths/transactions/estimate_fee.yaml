  summary: Estimate transaction fee
  description: |
    This operation estimates the transaction fee of a token transfer or a contract call for three different transaction speeds (slow, standard, and fast), based on factors such as network congestion and transaction complexity.
    
    You need to specify the transaction information, including the source address and destination address. 
    - If you do not include a `fee` object in the request body, the response will include estimated transaction fees and recommended fee limits from the chain.
    - If you do provide a `fee` object, the response will include fee estimates for the slow and fast transaction speeds with the provided fee as the standard speed fee.

    Note: 
    - The `max_priority_fee` in the EIP-1559 fee model and the `max_fee_amount` properties in the fixed fee model from the response represent the recommended values from the chain.
    - The `gas_limit` property included in the request body will be ignored in a fee estimation.
