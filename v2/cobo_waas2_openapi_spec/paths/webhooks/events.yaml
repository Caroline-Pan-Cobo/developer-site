  summary: List all events
  description: |
    This operation retrieves a list of webhook events that have occurred within the last 30 days.

    Note: The request will only return webhook events that have occurred to the wallets associated with your current API key. For example, if the current API key is only associated with Asset Wallets, any webhook events that have occurred to an MPC Wallet will not be retrieved with the current API key.
  operationId: list_events
  parameters:
    - $ref: "../../components/parameters/webhooks/endpoint_id_path_param.yaml"
    - description: |
        The event status. Possible values include:
        - `Success`: The event has been delivered, and the webhook endpoint has responded to the event.
        - `Retrying`: The event has been delivered, but the webhook endpoint has not responded. In this case, the WaaS service will retry delivering the event.
        - `Failed`: The event cannot be delivered and the WaaS service will stop retrying. This may occur if the number of retries reaches 10, or if the event has been delivered but the webhook endpoint responded with an error.
