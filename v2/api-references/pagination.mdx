title: "Pagination"
---

Pagination in the WaaS 2.0 API allows you to retrieve data in manageable chunks. You can control the page size and navigate through the dataset using three query parameters:

- `limit`: This parameter defines the maximum number of objects you want to receive in each response.

- `before`: This parameter specifies an object ID as a starting point for pagination, retrieving data before the specified object relative to the current dataset.  
 
    Suppose the current data is ordered as Object A, Object B, and Object C.  If you set `before` to the ID of Object C (`RqeEoTkgKG5rpzqYzg2Hd3szmPoj2cE7w5jWwShz3C1vyGSAk`), the response will include Object B and Object A.  
- `after`: This parameter specifies an object ID as a starting point for pagination, retrieving data after the specified object relative to the current dataset.  

    Suppose the current data is ordered as Object A, Object B, and Object C. If you set `after` to the ID of Object A (`RqeEoTkgKG5rpzqYzg2Hd3szmPoj2cE7w5jWwShz3C1vyGSAk`), the response will include Object B and Object C.  

**Notes**:  
- If you set both `after` and `before`, an error will occur.
- If you leave both `before` and `after` empty, the first page of data is returned.
- If you set `before` to `infinity`, the last page of data is returned.
