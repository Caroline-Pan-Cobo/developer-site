This article is targeted at WaaS 1.0 users who are considering upgrading to WaaS 2.0. It introduces the benefits of the upgrade and provides step-by-step instructions to successfully complete the upgrade process.

## Benefits of the upgrade

WaaS 2.0 is a complete upgrade from Cobo’s initial WaaS offering. By upgrading to 2.0, you can benefit from the following key features:

- A more holistic approach to accessing Cobo’s wallet technologies through a unified API for all four of Cobo’s [wallet types](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/introduction#an-all-in-one-wallet-platform).
- More webhook event types, including transaction and TSS request-related events, and more to come.
- Flexible usage models for MPC Wallets, including Organization-Controlled Wallets and User-Controlled Wallets.
- Programmatic control of smart contract wallets such as Safe{Wallet} with fine-grained access controls.
- Seamlessly transfer funds across multiple exchanges, including Binance, OKX, Bybit, Deribit, and more.

By upgrading to 2.0, you can also enjoy the full features of [Cobo Portal](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/introduction), including a powerful developer console where you can monitor API activities, view logs, and oversee webhook events and callback messages.

With the WaaS 2.0 API, you not only can integrate Cobo’s powerful wallet capabilities directly into your applications, but also build [Cobo Portal Apps](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/portal-apps/introduction) to significantly expand the capabilities of Cobo Portal.

## Differences between 1.0 and 2.0

The following table lists the major differences between the 1.0 and 2.0 versions:

## Upgrade to 2.0

This section introduces the detailed steps to upgrade from WaaS 1.0 to 2.0.

### Prerequisites

Reach out to our support team at[ help@cobo.com](mailto:help@cobo.com) to migrate from Cobo Custody to Cobo Portal.

### Get started with WaaS 2.0

Follow the instructions in [Get started with WaaS 2.0](/v2/guides/get-started/get-started-with-waas) to set up your account, create and register your API key, integrate a WaaS SDK if necessary, and send your first API request to the WaaS 2.0 service.

### Rewrite your code

Once you complete the initial setup, it is time to rewrite your code by replacing the 1.0 API operations with 2.0 operations. Refer to[ API operation comparison](#api-operation-comparison) for a detailed comparison between 1.0 and 2.0 API operations.

You can also refer to [Get started with Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets)](/v2/guides/custodial-wallets/get-started-asset-wallets) for a step-by-step guide on how to create a Custodial Wallet (Asset Wallet), generate wallet addresses, and receive and withdraw tokens. Guides for other wallet types will be available in the future.

### Set up webhook and callback endpoints

Set up the webhook and callback endpoints and register them in Cobo Portal. 

To understand webhook events, callback messages, and the differences in webhook/callback mechanisms between WaaS 1.0 and WaaS 2.0, refer to [Introduction to webhooks and callbacks](/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/introduction).

To learn the detailed steps of the setup, see [Set up a callback or webhook endpoint](/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/set-up-endpoint). To register the endpoint, see [Register a webhook endpoint](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/developer-console/webhooks-create) and [Register a callback endpoint](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/developer-console/callbacks-register).

<Note>The endpoints you set up for WaaS 1.0 will not receive any messages from the WaaS 2.0 service.</Note>

## API operation comparison

The following table lists the API operations needed for common wallet operations in WaaS 1.0 and 2.0 respectively. You can refer to this table when migrating your code from 1.0 to 2.0.
