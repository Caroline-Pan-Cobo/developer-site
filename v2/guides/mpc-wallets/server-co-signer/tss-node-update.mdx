When new versions of the TSS Node package are released, it is highly recommended to stay updated by upgrading to the latest version. After downloading a new version of the TSS Node package, please ensure to complete the following steps.


1. Stop the currently running TSS Node. 

```
sudo ./tss-node.sh stop
```

2. Back up key data (e.g. the `secrets.db` file, the passwords or the `password.key` file, and the config file).

3. Unzip the new version of the TSS Node package and overwrite the files in the old version. You can unzip the new version in the same folder used by the previous TSS Node package.

```
tar -xzf cobo-tss-node-generic.tgz
```

4. To ensure the proper functioning of the TSS Node, check its operating environment and pull the necessary container image.

```
sudo ./tss-node.sh status
```

5. Start the new version of the TSS Node, and verify its successful startup by ensuring that the version number and key data (such as the TSS Node ID) in the log match the expected values.

```
sudo ./tss-node.sh start
```
