This guide explains how to configure secure communication between your callback server and TSS Node using RSA key pairs.

## Generate and exchange callback keys

### 1. Generate callback server keys

On your callback server, generate an RSA key pair:

1. Generate a private key:
```bash
openssl genrsa -out callback-server-pri.pem 4096
```

2. Configure the private key on the callback server because you will need to use it to sign the callback response.

3. Export the public key:
```bash
openssl rsa -in callback-server-pri.pem -pubout >callback-server-pub.key
```

### 2. Get the TSS Node's callback public key

After initializing your TSS Node, retrieve its callback public key:
```bash
sudo ./tss-node.sh info
```

The output will include the callback public key:
```
INFO[2022-12-14T07:09:44Z] Callback public key:
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIICIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAg8AMIICCgKCAgEA4ki4fHY4/oSJOYBxBUI1
...
s8wADQvpbJTyPkkMyq/i5SkCAwEAAQ==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

### 3. Exchange public keys

1. Copy your callback server's public key to your TSS Node's installation directory, such as:
```
cobo-tss-node-generic
├── configs
│   ├── callback-server-pub.key
│   └── cobo-tss-node-config.yaml
```

2. Copy the TSS Node's callback public key to your callback server's configuration


## Configure TSS Node settings

Modify the `cobo-tss-node-config.yaml` file on your TSS Node to include the callback server's URL, public key, and other callback-related settings.

You can configure multiple callback servers for enhanced security. The TSS Node will only execute a task if all configured callback servers approve it. The following example shows how to configure if you have two callback servers:

```yaml
callback:
  cb_server_v2:
    - service_address: https://<CALLBACK_SERVER_URL_1>/v2/check
      pubkey_path: configs/customer-callback-server-pub-01.key
    - service_address: https://<CALLBACK_SERVER_URL_2>/v2/check
      pubkey_path: configs/customer-callback-server-pub-02.key
  token_expire_minutes: 2
  retry_times: 60
  sleep_seconds: 60
  request_timeout: 10
  monitor_interval: 1h
```

### Configuration parameters

- `cb_server`: A list of addresses of the TSS Node callback servers that receive the [v1 version](/v1/overview/mpc-wallet/callback/callback-server-requirements/keygen-request) of the callback request.  While still supported, we strongly recommend using the `cb_server_v2` option instead, as it provides more comprehensive request information and is more compatible with the WaaS 2.0 API.
- `cb_server_v2`: A list of addresses of the TSS Node callback servers that receive the v2 version of the callback request.
  - `service_address`: HTTP endpoint of your callback server.
  - `pubkey_path`: Path to your callback server's public key file.
- `token_expire_minutes`: JWT expiration time in minutes.
- `retry_times`: Maximum number of retry attempts for failed requests.
- `sleep_seconds`: Delay between retry attempts in seconds.
- `request_timeout`: Timeout duration for HTTP requests in seconds. Specifies how long the TSS Node waits for a response from the callback server before considering the request timed out.
- `monitor_interval`: Specifies how often the TSS Node checks the callback server's status. Use `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, or `h` for hours (e.g., `30s`, `5m`, `2h`). If omitted, status monitoring is disabled.

## Verify configuration

After configuring both servers:
1. Start your callback server
2. Start your TSS Node
3. Test the connection by initiating a task request
4. Verify the callback flow
