This guide explains how to deploy your TSS Node callback server.

## Sample callback server
Cobo provides example callback server implementations in multiple programming languages to help you quickly develop your callback server. You can find these examples in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CoboGlobal/cobo-mpc-callback-server-v2-template).


## General workflow

Your callback server must:
1. Implement HTTP endpoints for receiving task requests
2. Process JWT-signed messages from the TSS Node
3. Implement your custom risk control logic
4. Return signed responses to the TSS Node

### HTTP endpoint

The callback server must expose an HTTP endpoint with these specifications:
- Path: `/v2/check` (or any other path that aligns with your business needs)
  <Note>Remember to register your chosen path in the TSS Node's configuration file. For detailed instructions, refer to [Configure TSS Node settings](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/callback-server-configure#configure-tss-node-settings).</Note>
- Method: `POST`
- Content-Type: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

### Parsing the request

For each task request, the TSS Node:
1. Creates a `CallbackRequest` struct based on the task type (KeyGen, KeySign, or KeyReshare)
2. Serializes the `CallbackRequest` struct to JSON format to obtain `CallbackRequestJsonString`
3. Uses `CallbackRequestJsonString` as the JWT payload and signs it with its RSA private key (the TSS Node's callback private key)
4. Sends an HTTP POST request with the JWT in a form field named `TSS_JWT_MSG`

Your callback server must:
1. Extract the JWT from the `TSS_JWT_MSG` form field in the HTTP POST request
2. Verify the JWT signature using the TSS Node's callback public key
3. Extract the payload from the JWT and deserialize it into a `CallbackRequest` struct
4. Based on the `CallbackRequest` type, deserialize the `meta` field to obtain detailed request information

### Risk control implementation

Your callback server must implement risk controls to validate each task request. For each `CallbackRequest`, you should:
1. Analyze the request content
3. Apply your risk control policies to ensure the requested key share operation is legitimate and authorized
4. Return an approval or rejection decision

### Creating a response

To build the HTTP response, your callback server must:
1. Create a `CallbackResponse` struct based on your risk control decision
2. Serialize the `CallbackResponse` struct to JSON format to obtain `CallbackResponseJsonString`
3. Use `CallbackResponseJsonString` as the JWT payload and sign it with your callback server's RSA private key
4. Return the JWT directly in the HTTP response body to the TSS Node

<Note>
If the TSS Node doesn't receive a response, it will retry the request. After maximum retries, the TSS Node will consider the risk control decision as "REJECT."
</Note>

## Request and response format

For detailed specifications of the callback server communication, including request types, payload formats, and response handling, see [Callback Request and Response Formats](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/callback-server-data-structure).
