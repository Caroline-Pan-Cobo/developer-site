This guide outlines security best practices for implementing risk control in your server co-signer to ensure secure transaction signing.

## Embedded risk control rules

You can configure your embedded risk control rules through the `configs/cobo-tss-node-config.yaml` file as such:

```yaml
embedded_risk_control_rules:
  enable: true
  key_gen:
    reject_all: true
  key_sign:
    reject_all: false
  key_reshare:
    reject_all: true
  key_share_sign:
    reject_all: true
```

This configuration allows signing tasks only and rejects all other tasks.


## TSS node callback server security

To ensure transaction security and authenticity, implement the following security checks in your TSS node callback server:

1. Verify the transaction hash to prevent transaction tampering:
   1. Extract the raw transaction data from `extra_info.Transaction.RawTxInfo.UnsignedRawTx`
   2. Calculate the hash of this raw transaction data
   3. Compare it with the hash provided in `request_detail.msg_hash_list`
   4. Reject the transaction if the hashes don't match

2. Validate critical transaction parameters to prevent unauthorized or malicious transactions:
   - Gas fee: Ensure it's within acceptable ranges
   - Destination address: Verify against allowed addresses
   - Transaction amount: Check against configured limits
   - Chain ID: Confirm it matches your expected network
   - Other specific parameters as needed

### Auto-sweeping implementation

For MPC Wallets with auto-sweeping enabled, implement the whitelisting configuration to automatically approve transactions when the transaction hash is verified and the destination address is whitelisted.

You can access our [sample project](https://github.com/CoboGlobal/cobo-mpc-callback-server-v2-template/blob/master/cobo-mpc-callback-server-v2-golang/internal/verifier/sign.go) which demonstrates:
   - Transaction content parsing
   - Hash verification against signed message
   - Whitelist-based transaction approval

<Note>
The sample implementation is currently written in Go and is applicable to EVM chains only. You can extend it to other chains via [token_adapter](https://github.com/CoboGlobal/cobo-mpc-callback-server-v2-template/tree/master/cobo-mpc-callback-server-v2-golang/pkg/token_adapter).
