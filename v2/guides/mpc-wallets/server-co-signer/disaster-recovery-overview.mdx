This guide provides an overview of different restore and recovery methods to handle system failures and disaster scenarios for your server co-signer, and a comparison between them.

## Available methods

### Backup and restore

To prevent system failures or other unforeseen scenarios, you should regularly backup your TSS Node data. This includes:
- The `secrets.db` file containing your key shares
- The encryption password for the database

Use restore when you need to:
- Move your TSS Node to a new host
- Recover from system failure using your backup

The restore process uses your backed up data to recreate your TSS Node environment exactly as it was.

For details, see [Backup key shares](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/key-shares-backup) and [Restore key shares](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/key-shares-restore).

### Recover

There are two recovery methods available depending on your situation:

#### Recover key shares from another active holder group

Use this method when:
- Your key share is lost and backup is not accessible
- You have another active key share holder group available

This method requires assistance from another active key share holder group to recover your key shares.

For details, see [Recover key shares from another active holder group](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/recover-from-active-keys).

#### Recover root extended private keys
In the unlikely event of Cobo Portal discontinuing its services, you can reconstruct the root extended private keys corresponding to the vault by utilizing an active Recovery Group.

For details, see [Recover root extended private keys](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/recover-root-key).

## Method comparison

| Method | When to use | Prerequisites | Cobo involvement |
|--------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| Backup and restore | Moving to new host or system failure | Backup data | Not required |
| Recover key shares from another active holder group| Lost key share without backup | Active holder group | Required |
| Recover root extended private keys | Cobo service unavailable | A recovery group| Not required |

## Best practices

1. **Regular backups**
   - Back up your TSS Node data regularly
   - Store backups in secure locations

2. **Testing**
   - Regularly test your restore and recovery processes
   - Verify key functionality after any operation
