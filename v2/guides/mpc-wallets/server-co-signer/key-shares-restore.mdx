Restoring key shares means moving your backed up TSS Node data to a new host and configuring it to run with the same key shares as before. This process is necessary when you need to migrate your TSS Node to a different server or recover from a system failure.

You should restore your key shares on a host with the same environment as the original deployment. For example, if your `secrets.db` was generated on a Mac, you should set up a new Mac environment for restoration. Ensure the new host meets the server requirements specified in [Server requirements for deploying a TSS Node](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/tss-node-server-environments).

## Prerequisites

Before restoring your key shares:
1. Set up the TSS Node environment on your new host following the [server requirements](/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/tss-node-server-environments)
2. Download the same version of TSS Node software package that was used for the backup

## Restore process

1. Extract the TSS Node software package
2. Copy your backed up `db` folder to the extracted directory
3. Start the TSS Node

## Verify restoration

1. Check your key share information:
```bash
sudo ./tss-node.sh info group
```

2. In the output log, verify that the root extended public key matches the one displayed in Cobo Portal.

## Complete restoration

1. Restart your TSS Node
2. Enter the encryption password used when creating the backup
3. If the password is correct, your TSS Node will start running normally on the new host
