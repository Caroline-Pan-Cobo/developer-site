---

A server co-signer requires the following network environments to run optimally:

- No inbound connections are required.
- During installation (or upgrade) phase:
  - Able to access the apt sources of the system to install all necessary dependencies (only applicable to Ubuntu servers)
  - Able to access the Docker Engine installation files to install the Docker Engine
  - Able to access docker.io registry (the public Docker registry)
  - Able to access the Intel website to download the driver (applicable to a SGX-ready server)
- Runtime network requirements: Your server must have outbound access to the following endpoints:
  | Environment | Port | Domain |
  |------------|------|--------|
  | Development | 443 | ws.tss.dev.cobo.com |
  | Production | 443 | ws.tss.cobo.com |
  
  If you have configured a TSS Node callback server, the server co-signer should also be able to access the callback server.
