A server co-signer requires the following network environments to run optimally:

- No inbound connections are required.
- During installation (or upgrade) phase:
  - Able to access the apt sources of the system to install all necessary dependencies (only applicable to Ubuntu servers)
  - Able to access the Docker Engine installation files to install the Docker Engine
  - Able to access docker.io registry (the public Docker registry)
  - Able to access the Intel website to download the driver (applicable to a SGX-ready server)
- When the server is running:
  - Development environment: Able to access port 443 of ws.tss.dev.cobo.com. If you have configured a TSS Node callback server, the server co-signer should also be able to access the callback server.
  - Production environment: Able to access port 443 of ws.tss.cobo.com. If you have configured a TSS Node callback server, the server co-signer should also be able to access the callback server.
