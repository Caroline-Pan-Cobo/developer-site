title: "Transaction sources and destinations"
---

In WaaS 2.0, every transaction involves a source and a destination. The source indicates where the transaction originates, while the destination represents where the transaction is going, such as a wallet address, a signature, a contract, and more. Each transaction type corresponds to a specific set of source and destination types. For example, in a withdrawal transaction, the source will be a wallet created on Cobo Portal, and the destination will be either a wallet address or an Exchange Wallet. 

## Source and destination for each transaction type

Refer to the following table for the source and destination types corresponding to each transaction type. Detailed definitions for each source type and destination type can be found below the table.

<Note>If you transfer tokens between two wallets created on Cobo Portal, two transactions will be recorded: a deposit into the destination wallet and a withdrawal from the source wallet.</Note>
