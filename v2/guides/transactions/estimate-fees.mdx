title: "Estimate transaction fees"
---

<Note>This guide applies only to estimating transaction fees for transfers made from Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). An EOA is basically a type of account on the Ethereum network that is controlled by a person using a private key. </Note>

Transaction fees are required to process and validate transactions on a blockchain network, ensuring network security and efficiency. Cobo currently offers two methods for estimating transaction fees considering factors such as the source, destination, and the number of inputs and outputs:
- When you make a transfer on Cobo Portal, you can see the estimated transaction fee on the UI. 
- You can call the [Estimate transaction fee](/v2/api-references/transactions/estimate-transaction-fee) operation. 

When you call the [Estimate transaction fee](/v2/api-references/transactions/estimate-transaction-fee) operation, you need to specify the following parameters:
- `request_type`: The type of transaction, which can be a transfer or a contract call.
- `source`: The transaction source.
- `destination`: The transaction destination.
- (Only required for transfers) `token_id`: The ID of the token being transferred.
- (Only required for contract calls) `chain_id`: The ID of the chain on which the smart contract is deployed.

You will get the estimated transaction fee with different fee levels in the response, which varies based on the blockchain network and the fee model used.


## Fee models

Each blockchain may employ various fee models to calculate transaction fees, creating a one-to-many relationship with its fee structures. For example, Ethereum supports both the Legacy model and the EIP-1559 model.

Cobo currently supports transactions with four types of fee models:

| Fee Model | Calculation Method | Typical Blockchains Using This Model | Customizable Parameters | 
|-----------|--------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Legacy    | Transaction fee = gas price * gas units used<ul><li>Gas price: The gas price, in wei, represents the amount of ETH that must be paid to validators for processing transactions per gas unit used.</li><li>Gas units: A measure of computational work required to perform operations on the Ethereum network.</li></ul>   |      Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains      |           Gas limit. Refer to the response of the [Estimate transaction fee](/v2/api-references/transactions/estimate-transaction-fee) operation for details.          | 
| [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)  | Transaction fee = (Base fee per gas unit + priority fee per gas unit) * gas units used<ul><li>Base fee per gas unit: The base fee required to include a transaction in a block per gas unit used on the chain, dynamically adjusted based on network demand.</li><li>Priority fee per gas unit: An additional fee paid to miners to prioritize the transaction per gas unit used on the chain, also known as a tip.</li><li>Gas units: A measure of computational work required to perform operations on the Ethereum network.</li></ul>  | Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains  | <ul><li>Maximum gas fee per gas unit</li><li>Maximum priority fee per gas unit</li><li>Gas limit</li></ul>Refer to the response of the [Estimate transaction fee](/v2/api-references/transactions/estimate-transaction-fee) operation for details.  | 
| UTXO      | Transaction fee = fee rate * transaction size<ul><li>Fee rate:The fee rate, in sat/vByte, represents the satoshis you are willing to pay for each byte of data that your transaction will consume on the blockchain.</li><li>Transaction size: The total size of a transaction in bytes, affecting the total fee in UTXO models.</li></ul> | Bitcoin and other UTXO-based chains  | Maximum fee amount. Refer to the response of the [Estimate transaction fee](/v2/api-references/transactions/estimate-transaction-fee) operation for details.             |
| Fixed     | The transaction fee is fixed fee amount.  | TRON                            | Maximum fee amount. Refer to the response of the [Estimate transaction fee](/v2/api-references/transactions/estimate-transaction-fee) operation for details.                   |


## Fee levels

For the legacy, EIP-1559, and UTXO fee models, Cobo also supports three different transaction speed levels: slow, recommended, and fast. The faster the transaction speed, the higher the transaction fee. 

Besides, the transaction fee is also affected by the network conditions, such as congestion.

## How Cobo estimate the fees

| Fee Model | Estimation Method | 
|-----------|--------------------|
| Legacy    | <ul><li>Gas price: Calculated based on third-party nodes and self-managed nodes.</li><li>Gas limit: Queried from the corresponding node based on the source and destination.</li></ul>  | 
| [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)  | <ul><li>Maximum gas fee per gas unit: Calculated based on third-party nodes and self-managed nodes.</li><li>Maximum priority fee per gas unit: Calculated based on third-party nodes and self-managed nodes.</li><li>Gas limit: Queried from the corresponding node based on the source and destination.</li></ul>  | 
| UTXO      | <ul><li>Fee rate: Calculated based on third-party nodes and self-managed nodes.</li><li>Transaction size: Calculated based on the source spendables (UTXOs) and destination.</li></ul> | 
| Fixed     | <ul><li>Fixed fee amount: Calculated based on self-managed nodes.</li></ul>  |

<Note>The estimated transaction fee is based on current network conditions and may change by the time the actual transaction is made.</Note>
