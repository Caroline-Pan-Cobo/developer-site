This article explains how deposit and withdrawal transactions are processed for Custodial Wallets. It outlines the steps taken by you and Cobo, along with the various transaction statuses and sub-statuses your transaction might go through. You can call [Get transaction information](/v2/api-references/transactions/get-transaction-information) to query the current status and sub-status of your transaction.

- Cobo reserves the right to reject a deposit transaction if it violates compliance regulations. If rejected, the deposit will not appear on Cobo Portal or trigger any webhook events.
- If the transaction amount is below the minimum deposit threshold, the transaction will not be processed and no record will be created. You can call the [Get token information](/v2/api-references/wallets/get-token-information) operation to retrieve the minimum deposit amount for each token type.

## Withdrawal process

The following diagram illustrates how a withdrawal from your Custodial Wallet is processed:

- If a withdrawal is rejected or unsuccessful, the tokens will be returned to your wallet, and your balance will remain unchanged.
- If your withdrawal amount is smaller than the minimum withdrawal threshold, the withdrawal request will receive an error. You can call the [Get token information](/v2/api-references/wallets/get-token-information) operation to retrieve the minimum withdrawal amount for each token type.
