## Introduction

Webhooks and callbacks are essential mechanisms for the WaaS service to communicate with your application. After you register callback and webhook endpoints on Cobo Portal, the WaaS service sends push messages to the designated URL when an event occurs. They allow your application to receive real-time updates or notifications and to respond to events accordingly. Callbacks and webhooks serve distinct purposes within your business operations.  

| Mechanism | Description                        | Trigger Condition                                        | Required Actions Upon Receiving the Message              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Callbacks     | Serve similarly to a 2FA verification. | Triggered when you initiate a withdrawal or contract call using the WaaS API. | Check if the transaction meets expectations, and respond with a success status code (`200` or `201`) and a response body of `ok` or `deny` to indicate transaction approval or rejection. |
| Webhooks      | Serve as notifications.                 | Triggered when certain events occur such as transaction status changes.              | Respond with a success status code (`200` or `201`).             |

## Verify the signature

When you receive a callback or webhook message, you need to perform signature verification to ensure that the message is sent from Cobo.

The verification steps are as follows:

1. Retrieve raw body and timestamp. 

    Extract the original body string from the request payload and the timestamp from the request headers.

    ```python
    raw_body = request.body().decode('utf8')
    timestamp = request.headers.get("BIZ_TIMESTAMP")
    ```

2. Retrieve the signature. 

    Fetch the signature value from the request header.

    ```python
    signature = request.headers.get('BIZ_RESP_SIGNATURE')
    ```

3. Concatenate and hash the message.

    ```python
    import hashlib

    # Concatenate raw body and timestamp to form the message.
    message = "raw_body|timestamp"

    # Compute double SHA-256 hash.
    sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256(hashlib.sha256(message.encode()).digest()).digest()
    ```

4. Select Cobo's Public Key. 

    Depending on the environment that you use, select the corresponding public key for verification:
    - Development environment: `a04ea1d5fa8da71f1dcfccf972b9c4eba0a2d8aba1f6da26f49977b08a0d2718`
    - Production environment: `8d4a482641adb2a34b726f05827dba9a9653e5857469b8749052bf4458a86729`

5. Verify the signature using the Ed25519 algorithm.

    ```python
    import ed25519

    # Obtain the verifying key from Cobo's public key.
    vk = ed25519.VerifyingKey(bytes.fromhex(public_key)) 

    # Verify the signature against the computed message hash.
    vk.verify(bytes.fromhex(signature), sha256_hash)
    ```

## Sample code

To see examples of how to verify the signature in a webhook message, refer to the following files in the WaaS SDK GitHub repository:
- Python: [server_demo.py](https://github.com/CoboGlobal/cobo-waas2-python-sdk/blob/master/cobo_waas2/server_demo.py) (implemented based on the FastAPI framework)
- Java: [DemoController.java](https://github.com/CoboGlobal/cobo-waas2-java-sdk/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cobo/waas2/demo/DemoController.java) (implemented based on the SpringBoot framework)
