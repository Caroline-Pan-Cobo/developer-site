You can initiate settlement in three ways:

* Transfer: Through [on-chain transfer](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/transfers/introduction), directly transfer funds to an external wallet address.  
* Fiat withdrawal: Through the Cobo payment platform, convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency and transfer it to a specified bank account.  
* Stablecoin debit card/credit card: Transfer funds to a stablecoin debit card/credit card.

This article describes how to initiate a settlement request through the Payment API to implement fiat withdrawal. Additionally, you can use the Payment App to initiate a transfer or complete fiat withdrawal.

1. Call the [Get withdrawable balances](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/payment/get-withdrawable-balances) interface to query the current withdrawable asset balances.  
2. Call [Create settlement request](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/payment/create-settlement-request) to create a settlement request:  
   * When settling merchant funds, you need to specify the order number of the related payment order.  
   * When settling developer balances, you need to specify the currency and amount of the settlement.  
4. Follow up on the settlement request status:  
   * You can call the [Get settlement request information](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/payment/get-settlement-request-information) interface to query detailed information of a specified settlement request.  
   * You can also call [List all settlement requests](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/payment/list-all-settlement-requests) to query all settlement requests.  
   * You can also listen to the `payment.settlement.status.updated` event to get real-time updates on the settlement status.

**Calling Examples**

The following is an example of calling [Create settlement request](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/payment/create-settlement-request) to create a settlement request:
