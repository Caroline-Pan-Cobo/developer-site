Before starting the integration, you need to complete a series of initial configurations, such as enabling wallet services, creating API keys, and importing merchant information.


## Choose Wallet Type

Depending on the type of wallet you choose, the process of enabling wallet services will be slightly different.

* If you choose to use a custodial wallet, please refer to [Get started with Custodial Wallets](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/quick-start-guide-custodial-wallets) and complete the following steps:
  1. Set up your account and team.
  2. Refer to the [Security Checklist](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/security-checklist) and implement security best practices according to your actual business needs.
* If you choose to use an MPC wallet, please refer to the [MPC Wallet Quick Start Guide](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/quick-start-guide-mpc) and complete the following steps:
  1. Set up your account and team.
  2. Configure an MPC Vault. Since there may be a large number of collection transactions before settlement, and the transaction time is concentrated, please ensure that you have set up at least one [server-side signer](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/tss-node-overview) as your [main control group](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-main-group) or [signing group](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-signing-group) to achieve automated signing.
  3. Refer to the [Security Checklist](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/security-checklist) and implement security best practices according to your actual business needs.

## Enable Fee Station

In your daily business operations, you can manage various fees generated on Cobo through the [Fee Station](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/fee-station/introduction). If you need to use this feature, please contact the Cobo sales team to apply for activation.

## Confirm Independent Address Threshold

By default, the receiving address used for payment orders is cyclically reused - that is, an address used for one order may be assigned to other orders after the order's validity period ends. To avoid compliance risks caused by address reuse, it is recommended to use independent receiving addresses for large orders.

You can set an **independent address threshold** for the order amount. When the order amount is greater than or equal to this threshold, Cobo will automatically assign an independent receiving address for the order. If you need to set this threshold, please contact the Cobo sales team.

## Payment API Call Preparation

In the subsequent integration process, you need to call the Payment API to complete tasks such as creating orders and initiating settlements.

1. Refer to the [Developer Guide](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/get-started/get-started-with-waas) to generate a pair of API keys and API secrets, and register the API key in the Cobo Portal:
   * **User Role**: You can choose **Payment_Operator** or **Payment_Viewer**.
   * **Wallet Scope**: Configure carefully and avoid selecting **Any Type of Wallet**.
2. If you choose to use an SDK instead of manually writing API requests, you need to install the [SDK for the corresponding programming language](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/developer-tools/quickstart-python).

## Configure Webhook Events

* Refer to the [Developer Guide](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/set-up-endpoint) to set up a Webhook endpoint.
* In the Cobo Portal, [register the Webhook endpoint](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/developer-console/webhooks-create) and subscribe to [payment-related Webhook events](/v2/payments/status-and-events).

## Register and Verify Merchant Account

Call the Payment API to record the merchant name and associate the merchant with the wallet. When you create an order for a merchant, Cobo will create a receiving address for the order under the associated wallet. Each merchant must correspond to a unique wallet, and the same wallet can be associated with multiple merchants.

1. Create a new wallet:
   * You can create a wallet directly in the Cobo Portal. After creation, you can get the wallet ID on the wallet list page. Hover your mouse over the wallet name, and the wallet ID will be displayed automatically.
   * If you need to create a large number of wallets, you can call the [Create Wallet](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/wallets/create-wallet) interface to create them. You can get the wallet ID in the API response.
2. Call the [Create Merchant](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/payment/create-merchant) interface to create a merchant, and pass in the following information in the request:
   * Merchant name (`name`)
   * Wallet ID (`wallet_id`): The wallet ID of the wallet you created in the previous step.

**Call Example**

The following is an example of calling the [Create Merchant](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/payment/create-merchant) interface to create a merchant:
