This article describes how to complete the preparation work before integrating payment functions in the development environment, helping you verify functionality and ensure proper integration.

**Next Steps:**
After completing the development environment verification, when you are ready to deploy payment functions to the production environment, please refer to [Production Environment Prerequisites](/v2/payments/preparation-prod) for relevant guidance.

## Basic Preparation

### Choose Wallet Type

Cobo provides two types of wallets. You can choose the appropriate wallet type based on your actual business needs.

| Wallet Type | Private Key Management Mode | Cobo KYT Compliance Scanning | Applicable Scenarios |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Custodial Wallet](/v2/payments/glossary#custodial-wallet) | Cobo manages [private keys](/v2/payments/glossary#private-key)<br/>No need to worry about private key security risks | ✅ Automatically enabled<br/>Mandatory compliance, meets regulatory requirements | • Customers seeking convenient management<br/>• Businesses with mandatory compliance requirements&nbsp;&nbsp;|
| [MPC Wallet](/v2/payments/glossary#mpc-wallet) | You manage private keys yourself<br/>Achieve Self-Custody | ⚙️ Optional configuration<br/>Flexibly enabled based on business needs | • Customers requiring complete private key control<br/>• Businesses with flexible compliance requirements&nbsp;&nbsp;|

### Activate Wallet Service

Depending on your chosen wallet type, the wallet service activation process will vary slightly.

#### Create Account
As the first administrator of the team, please use the activation link provided by our sales team to create your Cobo Portal development environment account.

#### Set Up Cobo Guard
1. Log in to Cobo Portal [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login).
2. Click **Guide** in the lower left corner, then click **Bind Cobo Guard**.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Cobo Guard on your iOS device and associate your account with Cobo Guard.

#### Invite Members
1. Log in to Cobo Portal [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login).
2. Click the profile icon in the lower left corner, then click **Team**.
3. Click **Members**. On the **Members** page, click **Invite Member**.
4. Enter the member's email address and name, then select the appropriate [user role](/v2/payments/roles-and-permissions).
<Note>Please confirm on Cobo Guard that this invitation was initiated by you. Additionally, according to default business control rules, at least half of the team administrators must approve the invitation request on Cobo Guard.</Note>

   After receiving the invitation, new members should create their own accounts and set up Cobo Guard as described in the previous sections.


## Technical Configuration

### Install Payment Management App

Payment Management App provides a web interface that allows you to conveniently perform merchant management, order queries, settlement processing, and exception handling for daily operations. Installation steps are as follows:

1. Log in to Cobo Portal [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login).

2. Click the **Payment Management** card on the homepage.
<img src="/v2/images/payments/install-payment-app.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Payment Management App Intro" />

3. Click the **Install** button and follow the page instructions to complete the installation. This process may require administrator approval.

### Payment API Call Preparation

During the subsequent integration process, you will need to call the Payment API to complete steps such as creating orders and initiating settlements.

1. Refer to the [Developer Guide](/v2/guides/get-started/get-started-with-waas) to generate an API Key and API Secret pair, and register the API Key in Cobo Portal:  
   * **User Role**: Select **Payment Administrator**
   * **Wallet Scope**: Select **Any Wallet Type**
   * You do not need to configure a Callback Endpoint.
   * **Key Type**: Select **Temporary**

2. If you choose to use an SDK instead of manually writing API requests, you need to install the SDK for your programming language:
   - [Python SDK Quick Start](/v2/developer-tools/quickstart-python)
   - [Java SDK Quick Start](/v2/developer-tools/quickstart-java) 
   - [Go SDK Quick Start](/v2/developer-tools/quickstart-go)
   - [JavaScript SDK Quick Start](/v2/developer-tools/quickstart-javascript)

<Note>Official release channels provide stable version SDKs. If you want to fully utilize the latest API features, you can contact the Cobo sales team to obtain Beta version SDKs.</Note>

### Subscribe to Webhook Events

* Refer to the [Developer Guide](/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/set-up-endpoint) to set up a Webhook Endpoint.  
* [Register the Webhook Endpoint](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/developer-console/webhooks-create) in Cobo Portal and subscribe to [payment-related Webhook events](/v2/payments/status-and-events).


## Business Configuration


### Register Merchant and Associate Wallet

Call the Payment API to register the merchant name and associate it with a wallet. When you create orders or deposit addresses for this merchant, Cobo will create corresponding receiving addresses under this wallet. **Each merchant must correspond to a unique wallet, and one wallet can be associated with one or multiple merchants.**

<Note>If you are a merchant (directly serving payers), you only need to create one merchant and do not need to configure developer fees. Developer fees only apply to merchant platforms (such as PSPs, e-commerce platforms) charging fees to their downstream merchants.</Note>

1. Create a wallet in Cobo Portal.
     1. Click the **Create Wallet** button.
        - For custodial wallets, you need to click **Wallets**->**Custodial Wallets**->**Web3 Wallet** to enter the wallet creation page. On this page, you can click the **Create Wallet** button in the upper right corner to create a new wallet.
        <img src="/v2/images/payments/web3_wallet_entry.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Entry to Web3 Wallet" />
        - For MPC wallets, you need to click **Wallets**->**MPC Wallets**. On this page, you can click the **Create Wallet** button in the upper right corner to create a new wallet.
     2. Enter the wallet name and check **Auto Sweep** to ensure smooth settlement and refund operations.
       <img src="/v2/images/payments/create-wallet-auto-sweep.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Entry to Web3 Wallet" />

   
2. After creation, you can get the wallet ID on the wallet list page. Hover over the wallet name, and the wallet ID will be automatically displayed. 
     <img src="/v2/images/payments/wallet_name_hoverover.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Entry to Web3 Wallet" />
   

3. Call [Create merchant](/v2/api-references/payment/create-merchant) to create a merchant, passing the following information in the request:  
   * Merchant name (`name`)  
   * Wallet ID (`wallet_id`): The wallet ID of the wallet you created in the previous step.
   * Developer fee rate (`developer_fee_rate`):
     - Deposit mode: Set the developer fee rate through this field to calculate developer fees for each deposit. For example, setting it to 0.01 means charging a 1% fee.
     - Order mode: You don't need to set this field. In order mode, merchants have no fixed rate, and developer fees need to be specified separately when [creating orders](/v2/payments/create-orders).
     
     For detailed fee calculation methods, please refer to [Amount Definitions and Balance Calculations](/v2/payments/amounts-and-balances).

   After the call, you will receive a merchant ID (`merchant_id`), which serves as the unique identifier for this merchant in the Cobo system, used to identify this merchant in subsequent API calls.

**Call Examples**

Below are example codes for calling [Create merchant](/v2/api-references/payment/create-merchant) to create a merchant:

<Accordion title="Sample code in Python">
```py
import cobo_waas2
from cobo_waas2 import PaymentApi
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configurations.
configuration = cobo_waas2.Configuration(
   # Replace `<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>` with your private key
   api_private_key="<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>",
   # Select the development environment. To use the production environment, change the URL to https://api.cobo.com/v2.
   host="https://api.dev.cobo.com/v2",
)
# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with cobo_waas2.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
   # Create an instance of the API class
   api_instance = cobo_waas2.PaymentApi(api_client)
   create_merchant_request = cobo_waas2.CreateMerchantRequest(wallet_id="<YOUR_WALLET_ID>", name="<YOUR_MERCHANT_NAME>, developer_fee_rate="<YOUR_DEVELOPER_FEE_RATE>"
")


   try:
       # Create merchant
       api_response = api_instance.create_merchant(
           create_merchant_request=create_merchant_request
       )
       print("The response of PaymentApi->create_merchant:\n")
       print(api_response)
   except Exception as e:
       print("Exception when calling PaymentApi->create_merchant: %s\n" % e)
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Sample code in Java">
```java
import com.cobo.waas2.ApiClient;
import com.cobo.waas2.ApiException;
import com.cobo.waas2.Configuration;
import com.cobo.waas2.Env;
import com.cobo.waas2.api.PaymentApi;
import com.cobo.waas2.model.*;


public class Example {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
   ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
   // Select the development environment. To use the production environment, replace `Env.DEV` with
   // `Env.PROD
   defaultClient.setEnv(Env.DEV);


   // Replace `<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>` with your private key
   defaultClient.setPrivKey("<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>");
   PaymentApi apiInstance = new PaymentApi(defaultClient);
   CreateMerchantRequest createMerchantRequest = new CreateMerchantRequest();
   createMerchantRequest.setWalletId("<YOUR_WALLET_ID>");
   createMerchantRequest.setName("<YOUR_WALLET_NAME>");
   createMerchantRequest.setDeveloperFeeRate("<YOUR_DEVELOPER_FEE_RATE>");
   try {
          Merchant merchant = apiInstance.createMerchant(createMerchantRequest);
         System.out.println(merchant);
   } catch (ApiException e) {
     System.err.println("Exception when calling PaymentApi#createMerchant");
   }
 }
}
```
</Accordion>


### Configure Settlement Accounts

Based on your fund settlement needs, please contact the Cobo sales team to register the corresponding settlement accounts:

| Settlement Account Type | Description | API Query Interface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cryptocurrency Address** | Register external cryptocurrency addresses. Funds will be transferred directly to these wallet addresses. | [List crypto addresses](/v2/api-references/payment/list-crypto-addresses)&nbsp;&nbsp;|
| **Bank Account** | Register bank account information. Funds will be converted to fiat currency and settled to the account. Note: In the development environment, actual fiat currency conversion and settlement are not supported.  | [List all bank accounts](/v2/api-references/payment/list-all-bank-accounts)&nbsp;&nbsp;|


### Deposit to Fee Station

In your daily business operations, you need to manage various fees generated on Cobo through the [Fee Station](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/fee-station/introduction).


Before you start integration, please ensure you have sufficient funds in your Fee Station to pay for fees generated during settlement, refunds, and other processes:

- You can use USDT or USDC as fee currencies
- The recommended initial deposit amount is approximately $50 worth of cryptocurrency. You can adjust the deposit amount based on your actual business needs.

For specific deposit operation steps, please refer to the [Deposit to Fee Station](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/fee-station/deposit) documentation.


### Confirm Independent Address Threshold (Order Mode)

By default, receiving addresses used for payment orders are recycled, meaning that after an address is used for one order, it may be assigned to other orders after that order's validity period expires. To mitigate compliance risks from address reuse, it is recommended to use independent receiving addresses for large orders.

You can set an **independent address threshold** for order amounts. When the receivable amount of an order is greater than or equal to this threshold, Cobo will automatically assign an independent receiving address for that order. To set this threshold, please contact the Cobo sales team.
