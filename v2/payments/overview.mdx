* **Payment acceptance**：When the user chooses to pay with digital assets, you can call the Payment API to create a digital asset payment order and obtain the receiving address and the amount to be paid. All funds transferred to this address will be considered as the actual payment amount for the order after passing the compliance scan.  
* **Fund Handling**：  
  * **Sweeping**：When you initiate settlement, Cobo will sweep the funds scattered in various receiving addresses into a unified aggregation address, making it convenient for unified management and use.  
  * **AML/KYT Scanning**：Depending on the wallet type you choose, Cobo may actively perform compliance scanning on the funds. You can also use the Screening App provided by Cobo to perform compliance scanning on the funds.  
  * **Abnormal Handling and Refund**：When encountering abnormal situations such as overpayment or underpayment, you can initiate a refund to the customer or adopt other handling methods.
