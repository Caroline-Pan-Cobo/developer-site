This document explains the definitions of various amounts and the formulas for calculating balances during payment acceptance, refunds, and settlements.

## Merchant Funds and Developer Funds

Cobo maintains separate records for two types of funds: merchant funds and developer funds.

* Merchant funds: Funds belonging to each merchant, mainly sourced from the portion of the order's received amount attributed to the merchant.  
* Developer funds: Funds belonging to the developer (you), mainly including:  
  * The portion of the order's received amount attributed to the developer (you);  
  * Fees collected from merchants during refunds;  
  * Funds transferred from external wallets into Cobo Portal.

During payment acceptance, Cobo automatically splits the received order amount into merchant received amount and developer fee based on the ratio between the `order_amount` and `fee_amount` you provide when creating the order.


* **Order Received Amount**: The actual amount received for a payment order within its validity period, available in the `received_token_amount` field in order details.  
  * Any funds transferred to the order's receiving address during the validity period are counted in the order received amount.  
  * Funds transferred after the order expires are not included in the received amount, but are marked as transactions associated with the order.  
* **Merchant Received Amount**: The portion of the order received amount attributed to merchant funds.  
* **Developer Fee**: The portion of the order received amount attributed to developer funds.

## Merchant Withdrawable Balance

**Merchant withdrawable balance** refers to the total amount of funds available for settlement by a merchant at a specific point in time. You can query this via [Get withdrawable balances](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/payment/get-withdrawable-balances).

The calculation formula is: **Total merchant received amount** \- **Merchant non-withdrawable amount** \- **Merchant settled amount** \- **Merchant refunded amount** \- **Merchant under review/isolated/frozen amount**.


* **Total merchant received amount**: The sum of merchant received amounts for all payment orders of the merchant.  
* **Merchant non-withdrawable amount**: If the balance on a receiving address is below Cobo's minimum consolidation threshold, this portion is considered non-withdrawable. If the address is not a dedicated one, the balance will gradually increase with more orders until it surpasses the threshold. To settle non-withdrawable amounts, please contact Cobo support at [help@cobo.com](mailto:help@cobo.com) to request a manual consolidation before initiating settlement.  
* **Merchant settled amount**: The total amount of merchant funds that have been settled.  
* **Merchant refunded amount**: The total amount of merchant funds that have been refunded to users.  
* **Merchant under review/isolated/frozen amount**: The total amount of merchant funds included in order received amounts but currently under manual review, isolated, or frozen due to compliance checks.

## Developer Withdrawable Balance

**Developer withdrawable balance** refers to the total amount of funds available for settlement by the developer (you) at a specific point in time. You can query this via [Get withdrawable balances](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/payment/get-withdrawable-balances).

**Developer withdrawable balance** includes the following sources of funds:

* **Developer fee**: The portion of the order received amount (`received_token_amount`) attributed to the developer (you). Cobo automatically calculates merchant received amount and developer fee based on the ratio between `order_amount` and `fee_amount` in the order details.  
* **Refund fee**: Fees you collect from merchants in refund orders.  
* Funds you transfer from external wallets into Cobo Portal.

The following amounts are deducted during calculation:

* **Settled amount**: The total amount of developer funds that have been settled.  
* **Refunded amount**: The total amount of developer funds that have been refunded to users.  
* Funds transferred out to external wallets: Funds you transfer from Cobo Portal to external wallets.  
* **Under review/isolated/frozen amount**: Developer fees included in order received amounts but currently under manual review, isolated, or frozen due to compliance checks.  
* **Non-withdrawable amount**: If the balance on a receiving address is below Cobo's minimum consolidation threshold, this portion is considered non-withdrawable. If the address is not a dedicated one, the balance will gradually increase with more orders until it surpasses the threshold. To settle non-withdrawable amounts, please contact Cobo support at [help@cobo.com](mailto:help@cobo.com).
