In top-up mode, you may need to handle the following exception situations.

## Top-up address replacement

When a top-up address has multiple deposit transactions that fail compliance screening, Cobo will automatically deprecate that address and generate a new top-up address for that user. After address replacement, please ensure to promptly notify the user to use the new address for deposits. Any subsequent funds credited to deprecated addresses will not be included in actual received amounts and will not trigger top-up events.

## Compliance screening failure
When a transaction fails compliance screening by Cobo KYT or the Screening App, the system will trigger a `payment.transaction.held` event. The subsequent processing flow is as follows:

- If the transaction subsequently passes manual review:
    - If the order has not expired: The funds will be counted towards the order's actual received amount, and the order status will be updated accordingly based on the actual received amount
    - If the order has already expired: The system will trigger a `payment.transaction.late` event, and the funds will be counted towards the order's late payment amount

- If the transaction ultimately fails manual review:
    - The funds will be frozen and will not be counted towards the order's actual received amount
    - The order status will remain unchanged
    - The user needs to deposit sufficient funds again within the order's validity period and pass compliance screening for the order to transition to `Completed` status
  
For isolated or frozen funds:
- Cobo KYT: Please contact Cobo's support team through [help@cobo.com](mailto:help@cobo.com) for handling
- Screening App: You can evaluate and handle this within the app yourself
