In top-up mode, you may need to handle the following exception situations.

## Top-up address replacement

When a top-up address has multiple deposit transactions that fail compliance screening, Cobo will automatically deprecate that address and generate a new top-up address for that user. After address replacement, please ensure to promptly notify the user to use the new address for deposits. Any subsequent funds credited to deprecated addresses will not be included in actual received amounts and will not trigger top-up events.

## Compliance screening failure
When a transaction fails compliance screening by Cobo KYT or the Screening App, the system will trigger a `payment.transaction.held` event. The subsequent processing flow is as follows:

- If the transaction passes manual review: The funds will be counted towards the top-up amount.
- If the transaction ultimately fails manual review: The funds will be frozen and will not be counted towards the top-up amount
  
For isolated or frozen funds:
- Cobo KYT: Please contact Cobo's support team through [help@cobo.com](mailto:help@cobo.com) for handling
- Screening App: You can evaluate and handle this within the app yourself
